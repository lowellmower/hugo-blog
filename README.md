### Overview
This repo houses all the content for servering my personal site at [lowellmower.com](https://lowellmower.com)

### Documentation
There should be a link to that on my site, [here](https://lowellmower.com/categories/documentation/).

### TODO
As with all projects, there is debt to be paid...

- Implement git hooks to update droplet on push/merge to master
- Include ansible script for updating certs
- Collect some telemetry on traffic
- Write small CLI (maybe Rust?) to generate a new post with template
